#image-processing-fundamentals 
## What is Gray Level Transformation?
Gray level transformation (or intensity transformation) is used to adjust the contrast, brightness, and/or overall appearance of a grayscale image by modifying the intensity of its pixel values. The gray level image contains 256 levels of intensity for all pixels within the image, ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The gray level transformation applies a function to each of these pixels to modify the intensities and generate a new image. 

## Why is Gray Level Transformation Important?
### Modify the Brightness of an Image
### Enhance Contrast
### Highlight 


## Types of Gray Level Transformation
#### Linear (Contrast Stretching)
#### Logarithmic
#### Power-Law (Gamma)
#### Thresholding
