#c-fundamentals 

**Write a Function that Converts a Float to a String**. The following signature is provided:

```
int float2str(char *bufferOut, float value, size_t size, int precision);
```

- `char *bufferOut`: character array used to store the resulting string
- `float value`: variable that stores the float that must be converted to a string
- `size_t size`: size of `bufferOut`
- `int precision`: number of decimal places include in `bufferOut`
